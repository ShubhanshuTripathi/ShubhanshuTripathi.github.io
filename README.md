# About
As a Senior Software Engineer at Capgemini, I create end-to-end big data ETL pipelines in Azure using Python, PySpark, SQL, and Azure services. I migrated on-prem processes to cloud, implemented data quality and control checks, and performed data cleaning and transformations. I also worked on dynamic real-time status and metadata tracking using Python, and optimized Python programs to reduce average runtime by 23%.

I hold an active "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner" certificate, and I have a strong background in data science and machine learning. I also completed my M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from BIT, Mesra, with a thesis focused on this domain.

I am passionate about finding solutions for individual and organizational growth, and I focus on continuously improving and utilizing my skills. I collaborate with my team and clients to deliver high-quality results and value. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and to apply them to solve real-world problems.
