# About
As an Azure Data Engineer at Capgemini, I create end-to-end big data  ETL pipelines with medallion architecture in Azure using Python, SQL and PySpark. I migrated on-prem processes to cloud, implemented data quality and control checks, performed data cleaning and transformations, and created PII-masked views and extracts as per business requirements. I also automated the manual and repetitive tasks, optimized pipelines and  Python programs to reduce average runtime, and worked on dynamic real-time status and metadata tracking using Python.

I hold active “Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate”  (DP-203) and “AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner” (CLF-C02 / CLF-C01)  certificates, and have a strong background in Data Science and Machine  Learning. I also completed my M.Tech. in Computer Science and  Engineering from BIT, Mesra, with a thesis focused on this domain.

I am passionate about finding solutions for individual and organizational growth, and focus on continuously improving and utilizing my skills. I collaborate with my team and clients to deliver high-quality results and value. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and to apply them to solve real-world problems.
