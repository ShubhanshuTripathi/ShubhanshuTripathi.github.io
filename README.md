# About
As an Azure Data Engineer at Capgemini, I develop end-to-end data engineering solutions like EDH, ODS, Data Marts and Data Lakes. I am experienced in creating big data ETL pipelines with medallion architecture in Azure using Python, SQL and PySpark. I migrated on-prem processes to cloud, implemented CDC process with SCD Type 2, improved pipelines' reusability by developing metadata-driven architecture, performed data cleaning and transformations, and created PII-masked views and extracts as per business requirements. I also automated manual and repetitive tasks, optimized pipelines and Python programs to reduce average runtime, and worked on dynamic real-time status and metadata tracking of ETL job extracts using Python.

I hold active “Microsoft Certified: Azure Data Engineer Associate” (DP-203) and “AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner” (CLF-C02) certificates, and have a strong background in Data Science and Machine Learning. I also completed my M.Tech. (CSE) from BIT, Mesra, with a thesis focused on this domain.

I am passionate about finding solutions for individual and organizational growth, and focus on continuously improving and utilizing my skills. I collaborate with my team and clients to deliver high-quality results and value. I am always eager to learn new technologies and tools, and to apply them to solve real-world problems.

### Data Engineering
**End-to-end development of Enterprise Data Hub, Operational Data Store, Data Marts and Data Lakes with Views and Extracts generation**
- Migrated on-prem big data ETL processes to cloud, by creating storage event and schedule triggered pipelines with medallion architecture in Azure using Python, SQL and PySpark
- Implemented change data capture (CDC) process to store transformed data with SCD Type 2 implementation
- Improved reusability by developing metadata-driven architecture to create dynamic pipelines, which selectively fetch data by joining required source tables and applying transformations, to generate PII-masked views and extracts as per business requirements
- Optimized pipelines by applying conditional activity executions to reduce average runtime by 38%
- Identified and automated the manual and repetitive tasks (like SQL query creation) to save team’s time and efforts
- Implemented pre-load, data quality and data control checks
- Performed data cleaning and applied transformations on parquet and CSV big data feeds
- Implemented status email notification functionality in pipelines using Azure Logic Apps and Web Activities
- Identified and covered multiple edge cases to create a more fault-tolerant system

### Software Engineering
**Status and Metadata Reports Generation**
- Dynamic real-time status and metadata tracking of ETL job extracts using Python
- Extracted metadata properties and row counts dynamically from DAT and TXT files

**Miscellaneous**
- Optimised Python programs to reduce average runtime by 23%
- Automated Excel macro runs by creating Python scripts, to email daily consolidated status reports

# Education
**Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra**
- Degree: Master of Technology
- Branch: Computer Science and Engineering
- CGPA: 8.06
- Duration: July 2018 to July 2020
